[00:19.12] Your morning eyes, I could stare like watching stars
[00:26.32] I could walk you by, and I'll tell without a thought
[00:32.53] You'd be mine, would you mind if I took your hand tonight?
[00:40.18] Know you're all that I want this life
[00:58.68] 
[00:47.93] I'll imagine we fell in love
[00:50.60] I'll nap under moonlight skies with you
[00:54.62] I think I'll picture us, you with the waves
[00:58.13] The ocean's colors on your face
[01:01.98] I'll leave my heart with your air
[01:06.27] So let me fly with you
[01:09.46] Will you be forever with me?
[01:23.46] 
[01:47.19] You're my favorite place
[01:50.53] So always, I will stay
[01:54.17] The look that's on your face
[01:57.86] I think you feel the same
[02:01.85] Fate is an artist, and you'll be my muse
[02:05.23] I love you, I love you, I love you, I do
[02:08.95] If you are the ocean, then I am the blue
[02:12.64] I love you, I love you, I love you, I do
[02:32.64] 
[02:16.60] I'll imagine we fell in love
[02:19.26] I'll nap under moonlight skies with you
[02:23.17] I think I'll picture us, you with the waves
[02:26.62] The ocean's colors on your face
[02:30.58] I'll leave my heart with your air
[02:34.66] So let me fly with you
[02:38.21] Will you be forever with me?
